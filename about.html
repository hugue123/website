<h1>About Michael Xavier Hugue</h1>
<p>I am a Artist an a Graphic Designer based in MiamiMICHAEL X. HUGUE
   My name is Michael Xavier Hugue. I have been creating artwork and using my talent as a artist since the third grade. My parents encouraged me to participate in football, track and field, wrestling and baseball. Sports kept me focused in school and also humble. When I was younger I really did not understand the importance of school. It finally hit me in my sophomore year of High School. I realized that sports were not always promised. So I strove to be the best and to make A’s and B’s throughout my junior and senior years of high school. 
Eventually all my hard work paid off and I graduated with a 3.5 gpa. Throughout life there is always a valuable lesson taught or told. As an Artist, I love to display those life messages and lessons through my artwork, my entire collection that I have named “My Story”. 
      
   Attended Homestead Senior High School were I studied Art and Media Production. Shortly after graduation I enrolled at Miami International University of Art & Design, to pursue a Bachelor Degree in Graphic Design. As an artist am deeply influenced by music, all type ranging from R&B to Rap and Gospel. My skills applied in various mediums, such as acrylic, oil, watercolor and pencil. Mixed with my imagination is what makes my body of work an insightful and colorful way of viewing life. 


   I had my first two shows during Art Basel 2013, which is a grand accomplishment for me and has help me set the foundation I will use to continue to grow as a artist, and I develop my style. .</p>
